    Build a (supervised) neural network to classify the wines (Supervised neural network = multilayer perceptron = MLP in the jargon.)

    Because of the time required, use only 5-fold cross validation. Report briefly on the performance of this technique, including computational time required.

    Neural networks often perform better when their inputs are normalized, often to the interval [0,1] or [-1,+1]. Try using the Normalizer node to see if this helps.
