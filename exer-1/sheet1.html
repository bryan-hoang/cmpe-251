Expected to take you: 3 hours (after you&#39;ve covered the relevant material of course)

<p>
Note that these exercises are worth at most 2 marks each, and will be
marked simply: 2 -- good attempt, 1 -- half-hearted attempt, 0 -- not a
serious attempt.
<p>
The dataset we are going to work with for the first half of the term
is about how to predict the type of a wine based on some aspects of
its chemical composition. This is an easy dataset, with no missing values,
so we can focus on the way that different predictors work, especially
within KNIME.
<p>
You can find the dataset in the Week 1 slot. One file contains the dataset
itself, while the other describes the meaning of the attributes (that
is, the columns of the dataset).
<p>
The deliverable for this exercise sheet is a Word or
pdf document containing the answers to the questions below. Recall that,
on a Windows computer, the PrtScr (print screen) button copies 
the entire desktop view to the clipboard, while Alt-PrtScr copies 
only the active window.

<h3><font><font color="#ff0000">Questions:</font></font></h3>
<ol>
<li>
Your first task is to keep a diary, for one of the days of
this week, of all the times and places that you notice that
data is being collected about you as you live your life. 
For example, if you buy something online then data about your
credit card is obviously collected, but so is data about what kinds
of things you buy.
<p>
Try and capture as many different
sources as you can, remembering that some data capture is
hidden from you. Hand in a list of all of the sources you
notice, with brief comments on anything that seems interesting
or surprising.
<p>
</p></p></li><li>
The second task is to use the datasets to get familiar with
KNIME. Hand in a brief description of the properties you
extracted from the data.
<p>
For example, you might look at the distributions of the attributes,
properties such as means and standard deviations, and what the difference
between the minimum and maximum values for each attribute are.
<p>
Try to plot some values, including correlations between pairs of
attributes.
<p>
Play around with KNIME properties. For example, you could tweak some of
the example workflows to do simple predictions.
<p>
Some of these properties could also be investigated using a tool such as
Excel. While that is acceptable, you will need to become familiar with
KNIME, and the sooner the better, so do everything you can in the KNIME
environment.
