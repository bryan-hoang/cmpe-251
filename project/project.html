<h3><span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Questions:</span></span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>This dataset describes properties of users and their behaviours when they visit an online shopping site.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>The goals of the analytics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To make the most accurate prediction of who will buy something at the site; BUT this by itself is not very useful because it's only weakly actionable. So ...</li>
<li>To find some of the properties of users that are associated with eventual buying; this suggests ways to improve the site so that a greater fraction of visitors will become purchasers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Start early so that you can mull over your initial results and think about how to improve them. As we've seen, much of data analytics is iterative.</p>
<p>This is a design project, so it is inherently open-ended. But as a starting point, make sure that you have carried out the following steps (and label them as sections in your report):</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Properties of the dataset;</li>
<li>Clustering;</li>
<li>Predictors;</li>
<li>Attribute selection and ranking;</li>
<li>Actionable conclusions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you carry out these steps competently and you talk about the results and implications clearly, you can expect to get a mark in the B to B+ range. The Queen's marking scheme reserves As and A+s for those who show exceptional understanding and use of the course material. In this context, that might mean using a more difficult technique, noticing something subtle about the results, or getting a more subtle insight about how someone might act on these models, and there are other possibilities.</p>
<p>Your mark is not determined by your prediction accuracy. Rather, it depends on the <b>quality of your design</b>, which techniques you try, in which order. Don't be afraid to mention dead ends, as long as they weren't obviously dead before you tried them. You don't have to build every possible model, but you should build the best few, so that you know your results are not an accident.</p>
<p>Results need to be <b>discussed</b>. It isn't enough to produce a confusion matrix. Tell the reader what it means, or what you learn from it.</p>
<p>You aren't restricted to KNIME and you can use techniques other than those we've discussed in class or you've done on previous exercise sheets.</p>
<p>The overall project report should be 5-7 pages, not counting the space you need to display your results.</p>
<p>The most common way to get poor marks in this project is to try a few random or obvious things (in Week 11!!) without explaining why you chose them, and report the results without any discussion of what they mean.</p>
<p>Upload your project report by the deadline. You do not have to ask for the automatic extension, but the extended deadline is absolutely final, so plan accordingly.</p>
