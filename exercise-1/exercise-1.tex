    \question[2]{}
    Your first task is to k eep a diary, for one of the days of this week, of all the times and places that you notice that data is being collected about you as you live your life. For example, if you buy something online then data about your credit card is obviously collected, but so is data about what kinds of things you buy.

    Try and capture as many different sources as you can, remembering that some data capture is hidden from you. Hand in a list of all of the sources you notice, with brief comments on anything that seems interesting or surprising.

    The second task is to use the datasets to get familiar with KNIME.\@ Hand in a brief description of the properties you extracted from the data.

    For example, you might look at the distributions of the attributes, properties such as means and standard deviations, and what the difference between the minimum and maximum values for each attribute are.

    Try to plot some values, including correlations between pairs of attributes.

    Play around with KNIME properties. For example, you could tweak some of the example workflows to do simple predictions.

    Some of these properties could also be investigated using a tool such as Excel. While that is acceptable, you will need to become familiar with KNIME, and the sooner the better, so do everything you can in the KNIME environment.
