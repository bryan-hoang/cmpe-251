\begin{itemize}
  \item Looking at basketballwinloss data
  \item RF out of bag sampling
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Looking at prediction confidences can help determine why model might be misbehaving.
          \item Attribute statistics help see what the RF is determining to be a significant attribute.
        \end{itemize}
  \item Tree Ensemble learner is a generalization of RF (not the same thing, doesn't select attributes).
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Options: Tree Options \& Ensemble configuration.
          \item Out of bag predictions: model count should avg about a third
        \end{itemize}
  \item A method for determining the most important attributes involves using a math function \& sorting the important (splits times candidates)
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Iteratively remove unimportant attributes to try and increase prediction accuracy.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
